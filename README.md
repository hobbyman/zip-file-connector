## Methods
* <mark>CreateZip</mark>
* <mark>ExtractZip</mark> (not yet implemented)



### CreateZip Parameters

* File Array - string - example below
```
[
    {
        "filename" : "blah.txt",
        "content"  : "base64-encoding-of-the-file"
    },
    {
        "filename" : "whatever.jpg",
        "content"  : "base64-encoding-of-the-file"
    }
]
```
* Zip File Name - string - what it says

#### Getting the base64 encoding of a file in Sharepoint
Go to this [nice article](https://manueltgomes.com/reference/power-automate-action-reference/sharepoint-get-file-content-action/) for start. Basically, you need to get the output of **Get file content** into a variable or compose. BUT, pay attention, you need to get the **$content**; that's what will need to go into the **content** property in the **File Array**
